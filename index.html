<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>Under construction, more coming soon :)</p>
<p> This repo will serve as a blog during the nine months I will spend in Florence, Italy as a Fulbright Scholar.

    <p>JavaScript can change the content of an HTML element:</p>

    <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click Me!</button>
    
    <p id="demo">This is a demonstration.</p>
    
    <script>
    function myFunction() { 
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
    }
    </script>
</body>
